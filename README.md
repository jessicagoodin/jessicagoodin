### Hi there, I'm Jessica! 

I'm an aspiring, self-taught full-stack web developer, beginning with front end. 

I currently love JS, pair programming, and giving to/learning from communities of new AND experienced developers! I'm a part of a few communities in Discord and YouTube.

I'm searching for a career as a front end developer with a company with stellar culture and values that match my own. I'd also love to learn UX design. Long term I believe I'd fit very well in a developer relations role, as I love working, connecting, and learning with people.
