### These are the files for my portfolio page! This page will display info about myself, my most recent or most accomplished projects, my contact information, and my socials. 

I'm learning full-stack development beginning with front end. So far I've learned HTML and CSS, but I need more practice with styling in CSS. I've learned vanilla JavaScript and LOVE it. I'm beginning to learn the JS library React. I'm practicing with APIs.

I currently love JS, pair programming, and giving to/learning from communities of new AND experienced developers! I'm a part of a few communities in Discord.

I'm searching for a career as a front end or full-stack developer with a company with stellar culture and values that match my own. Long term, I'd love to freelance and create websites on the side.
