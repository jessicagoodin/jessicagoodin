## Hey there, I'm Jessica

I'm a self-taught front end web developer. 

I love Javascript, pair programming, and giving to/learning from communities of new AND experienced developers. I've also started a support community of parents of young children that are trying to break into tech and coding in their (very rare) spare time.

I am pursuing a career as a front end developer with a company with stellar culture and values that match my own. I'd also love to learn UX/UI design. Long term I believe I'd fit very well in a developer relations role, as I love working, connecting, and learning with people.
