<h2 align="center">Hey there, I'm Jessica</h2>

I'm a self-taught front end web developer. 

I love Javascript, pair programming, and giving to/learning from communities of new AND experienced developers. I'd also enjoy learning UX/UI design. 

I lead ParentStack, a discord community for parents that are trying to break into tech and coding in their (very rare) spare time.

I am pursuing a career as a front end developer with a company with stellar culture and values that match my own. 
Long term I believe I'd fit very well in a developer relations role, as I love working, connecting, and learning with people.
